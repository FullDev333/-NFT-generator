### Stick the BUIDLer
Stick born on 28/8/2k21 during a demo of an [open source](https://github.com/yoyoismee/NFT-generator) NFT project. At the time [M.](https://www.theequalityinstitute.com/equality-insights-blog/non-traditional-honorifics-and-why-they-matter) Stick was a simple person. However, as the project progress, Stick gains new ability as more feature released. So now Stick became the de facto mascot of the project.

Stick believe in the BUIDL<sup>[1](https://consensys.net/developers/buidlnetwork/), [2](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/buidl).</sup> movement. Xis little dream is to see mass adoption and the next generation of NFT. Therefore, Xe build tools, work with artist, and even dedicated xeself as the test subject. Stick love coffee, beers, and snack. Xe keep joking about being a Coffee -> Code converter. Unlike xis shy developer friend Stick like to meet new people, do weird shit and have fun. Stick try to get a Twitter, but Jack Dorsey think xe's too young. Hey, why can't 0 y/o stick have twitter?!? (will figure this out later) for now, you can meet Stick in the [repo](https://github.com/yoyoismee/NFT-generator).


As for this collection, it's simply records of Stick's journey in the evergrowing NFT community. Stick will release in a limited edition series. each will be in line with a key milestone or event. (probably driven by the need for a demo). 

Come come, don't be shy. Stick wanna know you all. :)
